## [A decade of DL](https://future.a16z.com/a-decade-of-deep-learning-ai-startup) - Q&A with Richard Socher
  - Academia vs Startups
  - transition from startups to large enterprises 
      - AI tooling startups in B2B space - implement the model via Huggingface; scale the model analytics as they train it via Weights and Biases; and deploy the model via ZenML.
      - Enterprise budget - The vast majority of startups are working on applications and applied AI, rather than basic research; larger companies can do both.
  - B2B startups building horizontal applications are successful today
      - As a vendor in the machine-learning tooling space, you must not take away too much of the control.
  - How evolution of networks and models changed how someone might think about starting an AI product company.
      - We’re not really brain-inspired or theory-inspired or principles-inspired – we’re GPU-inspired. We’re mostly inspired by what works well on a GPU.
  - But algorithmic advances do make a difference, right? you.com, ability to do more with less data
      - And the only reason a small company like you.com can compete with a large company like Google is because of the progress we’ve seen in AI. In particular, when it comes to so-called unsupervised and transfer learning. 
  - Speaking of search: One big thing I noticed about you.com is the way it summarizes results.
      - Although it doesn’t sound that cool, summarization is actually one of the hardest AI tasks, especially in natural language processing. 
      - And I think summarization is an important technology trend that more and more people in the next couple of years will appreciate as they see their time disappearing. When your time is valuable, you want simple tools to help you get stuff done.
  - Advice for someone entering the AI space right now?
      - Even the Stanford CS224 NLP lessons are out there, so you can go quite deep if you want to. 
  - How far can you get just using, say, cloud APIs and various levels of abstraction versus having to really get a meaningful understanding of how this stuff works?
      - But the abstractions are still leaky and they’re not perfect. So, the more important the application – the more important it is to your company, affected users, or your career – the more you still want to have experts that understand these systems deeply. Experts that know how to fix certain errors or performance issues, and also folks who think through how that AI system might impact people. Only then can you really automate certain processes in a way that is safe and maximizes positive impact.
