[V1 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
  - Depthwise separable convolutions
  
[V2 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)
  - introduces two new features to the architecture: 
    1) linear bottlenecks between the layers, and 
    2) shortcut connections between the bottlenecks
    
[V3 2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Howard_Searching_for_MobileNetV3_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
  - harness multiple network architecture search algorithms as well as advances in network design
  - adapt nonlinearities like **swish** and apply **squeeze and excite** in a quantization friendly and efficient manner
