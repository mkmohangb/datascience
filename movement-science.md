[Movement science needs different pose tracking algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10226) 2019

1. Current pose tracking algorithms fall short of the needs of movement science
  - metrics currently used for evaluating pose tracking algorithms use noisy hand-labeled ground truth data
  - do not prioritize precision of relevant variables like three-dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, and forces

2. Pose tracking provides the opportunity to conduct studies on people of all sexes, shapes, sizes, and ages
3. Pose tracking algorithms need to estimate different movement quantities
  - consecutive time frames are treated as statistically independent
  - ground truth data benchmarks currently used do not include quantities important to movement science like velocity, acceleration, and forces
  - benchmark datasets do not consist of the types of movements encountered in movement science
    
      * _Three-dimensional position, velocity and acceleration_
      * _External contact forces_
      * _Absolute mass, length and inertia_ => 
      * _Pose tracking with task and subject generality_ => Infants have a comparatively larger torso and head while elderly individuals often have a hunched posture and use walkers or crutches; these body configurations are less typically seen in the image datasets used to train pose tracking models. we show an example of this where the pose estimation algorithms completely fails to detect an upside-down gymnast while still detecting a sitting human with similar amounts of blur, likely due to not being exposed to training data that contains a gymnast mid-task.
      * _Body contact and partial occlusion_ => These issues with not detecting contact and partial occlusions can be dealt with, for instance, by creating training examples by augmenting ground truth data such that individuals from distinct images are artificially brought in contact or occluded, to train the algorithms to better detect such scenarios.
      * _Fixed frame of reference_ => the estimates of body motion need to be in a fixed frame of reference. For example, what matters for understanding the progress of an individual undergoing physiotherapy is the knee angle in the bodyâ€™s frame of reference not in the camera frame of reference.
